This is the first project assignment for The Odin Project. The requirements were to recreate the Google homepage in HTML and CSS.

I glossed over the instructions suggesting to try to position everything on your own before looking at developer tools. Since I have done similar projects before, but never spent much time looking at style definitions in the devtools, I actually spent the majority of my time investigating what information I could glean from them. Turns out, there's a wealth of information there! I was able to mostly faithfully recreate the look of the Google Homepage by inspecting each element and looking at its styles.

In the end, this was less successful and an exercise actually building a website. The structure of the page is kind of a mess - where I'm sure there's good reason for all the layered DIVs on the real Google page (I guess I'm giving them a lot of credit there), for a simple page that is just recreating the look with none of the functionality, it's pretty sloppy and disorganized. I would like to go back and do this project again in the future but follow the instructions as intended, building from scratch without looking at the devtools, to see if I can create an identical look with a more elegant structure.
